hwk3 Newtons Method
find the x-intercepts of the function f(x) = cos(x)-x = 0.
f is f(x) and fp is the derivative of f(x) with respect to x

In Matlab:

f = inline('cos(x)-x');
fp = inline('-sin(x)-1');

while(feval(f,midpoint) > 0)
midpoint = midpoint - (feval(f,midpoint)/feval(fp,midpoint))
end

midpoint = 

  
   0.755222417105636


The exact answer calculated using wolfram alpha is 0.7390851332151606

which means the percentage error for this exercise using Newtons method is = 0.016137248
